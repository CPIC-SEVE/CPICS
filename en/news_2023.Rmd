Were you at the [CSPB](https://cspb-scbv.ca/) 2023 meeting at U. Laval?

Centre SÈVE was well represented (and so was the CSIPC) this year, with several talks and posters from students, postdocs and professors from UQTR, UQAM, UdeS, McGill, ULaval, UQAR and other universities!

We wish to congratulate [Charles Roussin-Léveillée] for receiving an honourable mention for the <em>Ragai Ibrahim Award</em> for his paper on [how bacteria use conserved effectors to create an aqueous environment in the leaf apoplast](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312822000920), he also received the <em>Prix Relève Étoile</em> from FRQNT for the same paper. Bravo, Charles!!!

Charles research supervisor and Centre SÈVE's director [Peter Moffet] received the <em>Mary Spencer Award</em> for his outstanding research and outreach in the plant biology community. Congratulations, Peter!

Did you know Centre SÈVE's summer school this year was in Morocco? Yes, the [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/um6p/) hosted several Centre SÈVE students and professors for this extraordinary learning opportunity.

[Snehi Gazal], our vice-president, and [Prabhjot Sanghera], our secretary, taught about their projects, visited the area and learned about the Moroccan culture.

We'd like to welcome our new secretary [Prabhjot Sanghera], who is doing his Master's at McGill University, and our new treasurer [Charlotte Blasi], who is finishing her doctorate degree at the Université Sherbrooke.

With a full committee, we now can plan the year. We look forward to seeing you at the [Canadian Society of Plant Biology](https://www.cspb2023.org/) at Quebec City in June!

Also, our long time secretary, [Aracely Maribel Diaz Garza], stepped up to be president, helped by our previous VP communication, [Snehi Gazal]. Thank you for your leadearship!

We would like to thank the members that are now leaving the committee for their work these previous years: [Nicolas Sene], [Serge Nouemssi], [Théo Devèze] and [Jennifer Paillassa].
